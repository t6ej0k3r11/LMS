The system requires immediate attention to security hardening before any production use.

**Priority Action Plan:**

1. **Week 1-2**: Fix all critical security issues (password hashing, input validation, XSS protection)
2. **Week 3**: Implement database integrity and authorization improvements
3. **Week 4-6**: Performance optimization and testing infrastructure
4. **Week 7-8**: Feature completion and mobile optimization

**Overall Assessment**: The system has strong potential but requires significant security and performance improvements before production readiness. With the recommended fixes implemented, the system can achieve production-grade reliability and security.

**Final Recommendation**: **DO NOT DEPLOY** until all critical and high-priority issues are resolved. The current system poses unacceptable security and data integrity risks.
