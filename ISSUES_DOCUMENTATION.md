# Quiz System Issues & Bugs Documentation

## Critical Issues (Block Production Deployment)

### Issue #1: No Input Validation in Models

**Severity:** Critical
**Description:**
All Mongoose models (User.js, Course.js, Quiz.js, etc.) lack schema validation, allowing invalid data types and malicious input to be stored in the database.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Attempt to create a user with invalid email format
2. Submit quiz data with malformed question structures
3. Create course with negative pricing values

**Expected Behavior:**
Models should reject invalid data and provide clear validation errors.

**Actual Behavior:**
Invalid data is accepted and stored, potentially causing system instability and security vulnerabilities.

**Environment:**

- All environments (development, staging, production)
- Node.js/Express backend with MongoDB

**Screenshots/Logs:**
